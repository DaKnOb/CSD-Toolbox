The OpenHost Project
This service operates 24/7 and checks all lab computers storing data about their uptime.
For more info, contact daknob@tolabaki.gr

Please do not interrupt the service.

INFO:
The OpenHost project, created by DaKnOb for the Computer Science Department at the University of Crete is a host monitoring tool that measures the uptime percentage of each host on the network, the logged in users, the status (online/offline) and also whether a remote filesystem is mounted or has been unmounted. It also has support for e-mailing a user either when a host goes down or when a filesystem has been unmounted. 

DOCUMENTATION:
uptimes/      ::: Amount of pings each host replied to
check.py      ::: Operating Python Script
README        ::: The current text file
hosts         ::: All hosts to be checked by the script
session       ::: Total rounds of sent pings
getstats.py  	::: Print the uptime of each host
index.php     ::: Show a good looking webpage of all the information
status/       :::	An indicator on whether a host is online or offline
uid/          ::: Amount of users logged in to each host
userd         :::	Client on all monitored machines
init          ::: Bash script to run daemon on monitoring server

Setup:
This script can monitor an unlimited amount of hosts with the following characteristics:
1. Every host has a common filesystem mounted in a particular directory (same for all hosts)
2. One of the hosts (the server) executes ./init. (Prefer one with uninterruptible uptime)
3. One of the hosts has a webserver with PHP so the "OpenHost" folder is accessible to the web.
4. Every host has a cron job that executes /userd every one minute. 
5. You did not move ANY file to ANY OTHER DIRECTORY.
6. You have mail/sendmail set up to send e-mails.
